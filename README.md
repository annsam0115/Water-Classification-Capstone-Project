# CIND820
Big Data Analysis Project

This repository consists of the following:
1. Draft project abstract
2. Draft project report
3. Initial code in python
4. copy of the original dataset

The project report will be consistent with details within an academic paper. The report is current in draft form.
The upload code is accessible via google.colab in python

The notebook includes headings and some comments to help readers follow the process of data analysis.
1. Data preparation section includes general investigation of the dataset
2. Dealing with missing values, outliers, and imbalance of data walks through those respective processes
3. Exporation of the dataset using ANOVA and PCA
4. Preprocessing of the dataset 
5. Hyper-tunning parameters within each of the prediction/classification models
6. Modeling using: Logistic Regression, KNN Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost Classifers
7. Comparison of the model's performances
8. Post-predictive analysis

A final power-point presentation will be uploaded once completed.
